SKOSEd is a plugin for Protege that allows you to create and edit thesauri (or similar artefacts) represented in the Simple Knowledge Organisation System ([SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)).

<br>
I've recently added a new version of the SKOSEd plugin that is compatible with Protege 4.1. Not a lot has changed, but one major change is that the SKOS label properties have moved from data properties to annotation properties. I have put a release in the downloads area that keeps the old data properties for labels, but I will soon release a version with the proper fix, along with some support to help users update their SKOS files.<br>
